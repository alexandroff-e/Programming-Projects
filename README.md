# Programming-Projects
A repository of some of my relevant programming projects. These range from statistical analysis of experimental data to numerical and Monte Carlo simulations. Although all the projects relate to physics in some way, they all contain programming and data analysis techniques that can be employed outside of the physical sciences. The projects included are:

### 1. Monte Carlo Simulation of Physical Systems - Neutron Penetration:

Monte Carlo simulation of the penetration of tens of thousands of neutrons through different materials in 3D. This is followed by statistical analysis of the resulting data to calculate relevant characteristics of simulated materials. Results are visualized in 3D plots using matplotlib.

### 2. Numerical Simulation of Physical Systems - The Damped Harmonic Oscillator:

Numerical integration is used to simulate the motion of a harmonic oscillator (e.g. a pendulum) in situations where an exact solution is impossible to find. Multiple numerical integration methods are used, and their accuracy is analysed. 

### 3. Analysis of Experimental Data - Measuring Drop Spreading Law: 

Statistical analysis of experimental data (namely the rate at which a droplet on a surface spreads out as a function of its radius), including model-fitting by linear regression and error analysis.

### 4. Summer Project - The Ising Model and The Metropolis Algorithm:

Independent summer project in which Monte Carlo methods are used to simulate the behavior of magnets subject to external conditions such as temperature. The evolution of these simulations are visualized as gifs using matplotlib.

<br> Specific descriptions of each project can be found in the relevant notebooks.
